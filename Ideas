Ideas so far:
sacrificing elements/mechanics for additional power

Perhaps something like starting with a lot and giving up/getting rid of things
Like parts of the ui

every level or stage, you have to sacrifice something

Here's a simple idea: you're a friendly neighbourhood sphere doing your own thing, and as you go about your life things disappear, families divided, tending towards nothingness then the character realises it's the cause and goes on a journey to sacrifice itself so that others might live.
